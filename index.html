                        <li>Within two weeks of joining Storis Inc., I was working with clients and taking on my first
                            large
                            project. I have since led a number of projects from scratch and refactored existing code to

                        <li>Refreshed the company demo website and provided a live demo to Sales, Managers, and the
                            company
                            President, resulting in positive feedback and a better understanding of the product by the
                            sales
                            team.</li>

                        <li> Experience with Software development with VueJS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Laravel, building

                            maintaining scalable web applications, unit testing and integration testing, code review and
                            continuous integration, Strong problem-solving and analytical skills, Excellent

                        <li>Developed internal tools that optimized the way Meteorologists read and send out data,
                            resulting
                            in improved efficiency and accuracy.</li>
                        <li>Produced dynamic components in VueJS to meet daily ticket requirements.</li>
                        <li>Participated in daily PRs and code reviews, ensuring the quality and consistency of the
                            codebase.</li>
                        <li>The internal tools that I developed optimized the way Meteorologists read and send out data,
                            resulting in improved efficiency and accuracy. This is a significant impact, as
                            Meteorologists
                            rely on accurate and timely data to produce accurate forecasts. More efficient and accurate
                            data
                            flow can lead to more accurate forecasts, which can have a positive impact on public safety
                            and
                            the economy. For example, if a Meteorologist can detect a severe weather event earlier and
                            more
                            accurately, they can issue a warning sooner, giving people more time to prepare. This can
                            help
                            to reduce the loss of life and property. Additionally, more accurate forecasts can help
                            businesses to make better decisions about things like inventory and staffing levels, which
                            can
                            improve their efficiency and profitability. Overall, my work on developing internal tools
                            for
                            Meteorologists has a positive impact on public safety, the economy, and the environment.
